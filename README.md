## OpenAI API Key

Create a .env.local file in the root of the repo with your OpenAI API Key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```
                                                                                         |
If you do not provide an OpenAI API key with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, users will have to provide their own key.

If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
